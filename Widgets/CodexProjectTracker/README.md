# Codex Usage for DockDoor Pro

A lightweight DockDoor Pro widget for keeping Codex usage, credit balance, recent chats, project activity, and local Codex defaults visible from the dock.

**Current release:** `3.0.1`

**Marketplace PR:** [ejbills/dockdoorpro-widgets#20](https://github.com/ejbills/dockdoorpro-widgets/pull/20)

## Highlights

- Usage countdown ring in the dock, with a built-in rainbow ring toggle.
- Rotating dock cards for account limits, selected model, task count, and chat count.
- Panel view with credits, general usage, model-specific limits, task/chat totals, and recent Codex sessions.
- Clickable recent chats that open Codex tasks through `codex://threads/<session-id>` when a session id is available.
- Local model and reasoning default controls for Luna, Sol, Spark, Instant, Medium, and High.
- DockDoor settings schema for session folder, usage state file, recent session count, budget window, and rainbow mode.

## Lightweight Design

Codex Usage is intentionally thin. It reads a small local snapshot, renders with native SwiftUI, and refreshes on a modest interval. The optional live-sync agent performs one short local Codex app-server request per minute and exits; there is no persistent helper daemon or widget-side network activity.

The compact dock card rotates every few seconds, session/usage snapshots refresh periodically, and the expanded panel uses a slower label refresh because the data does not require second-by-second updates. That keeps the widget visually alive while staying low on energy and memory use.

## Important Boundary

The model and reasoning buttons update local Codex defaults in `~/.codex/config.toml`. They apply to new local Codex work after the setting changes. They do not hot-swap the model or reasoning level of an already-running chat.

## Runtime Data

The widget reads Codex session files from `~/.codex/sessions` by default. The live-sync companion requests the signed-in account limits from Codex's local app-server and writes them atomically to `~/.codex/usage.json`. That file is authoritative because legacy session telemetry may describe a different or expired usage window. If the file is unavailable or invalid, the widget falls back to the newest General and model-specific `rate_limits` events in session telemetry, then to local token-window estimates.

See [examples/usage.json](examples/usage.json) for the account-usage shape used by the current build.

## Live Account Sync

Install the optional one-shot sync agent after installing the widget:

```bash
Scripts/install-usage-sync.sh
```

It refreshes `~/.codex/usage.json` from the official local `account/rateLimits/read` RPC every 60 seconds. Each invocation exits after the snapshot is written, and a bounded retry handles occasional slow app-server startup without replacing the last valid data.

Logs are written to `~/Library/Logs/CodexUsageWidget/`. To remove the agent:

```bash
Scripts/uninstall-usage-sync.sh
```

## Settings

DockDoor Pro exposes these widget settings:

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex Sessions Folder | `~/.codex/sessions` | Where recent Codex task/session JSONL files are scanned. |
| Recent Session Count | `5` | Number of recent chats shown in the panel. |
| Usage Budget (M tokens) | `200` | Fallback rolling-window budget when account usage data is unavailable. |
| Usage Window Hours | `5` | Fallback rolling-window length. |
| Usage State File | `~/.codex/usage.json` | Authoritative current-account snapshot produced by the optional live-sync agent; session telemetry is the fallback. |
| Rainbow Usage Ring | `On` | Uses the rainbow/glow usage ring instead of a single-color ring. |

The panel also includes a small palette button in the header. That button toggles the same `Rainbow Usage Ring` preference without needing to open DockDoor Pro settings.

## Build

From this folder:

```bash
bash Scripts/build-widgets.sh Widgets/CodexProjectTracker
```

Build output:

```text
Build/CodexProjectTracker.bundle
Build/CodexProjectTracker.bundle.zip
```

## Install Locally

Copy the built bundle into DockDoor Pro's widget folder:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Application Support/DockDoorPro/Widgets"
cp -R Build/CodexProjectTracker.bundle "$HOME/Library/Application Support/DockDoorPro/Widgets/"
```

Restart DockDoor Pro after replacing an installed bundle.

## Marketplace Prep

This repository is the review and documentation home for marketplace PR [#20](https://github.com/ejbills/dockdoorpro-widgets/pull/20). Discord review and future community updates continue in the [canonical v3.0.0 repost](https://discord.com/channels/1312172160931856464/1532985348374659092); the older forum thread is superseded because its starter message was deleted and Discord cannot restore it.

Before opening the marketplace PR:

- Confirm the widget builds with the current DockDoor Pro widget SDK.
- Confirm the screenshot in `screenshots/codex-usage-panel.png` matches the current UI.
- Confirm `widget.json` uses the marketplace-ready name, description, icon, and principal class.
- Add any new real-world screenshots to `screenshots/`.
- Use [docs/MARKETPLACE_SUBMISSION.md](docs/MARKETPLACE_SUBMISSION.md) as the submission checklist.
